Started in a garage and laptop, when Ano Van first started developing Pasar Kode. He could not have imagined that his creation would eventually lead to the development of Pasar Kode as we know it today, which is being visited by people of any language. The first version of "Pasar Kode" called Portal Source Code Indonesia in Indonesian language, was online in middle of Ramadhan 2013. One of the basic vision of development is share, jobs, sell, buy all about the source code, everyone can participate.
